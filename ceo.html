			<div class="slogan title">Dear clients and Partners,</div>
			<p>Today, we are delighted to announce that Triasetâ€™s Brand Refresh initiatives will commence on the 1st of
				April, 2022. This has been a long time coming. While our name remains unchanged, our refreshed Brand
				Identity will modernise our brand and enhance our visibility in the ecosystem. We will surely see
				improvements in the areas of visual identity, personality, equity, communication and positioning. Our
				brand
				assets such as company logo, official corporate documentations and website will undergo necessary
				changes
				that are meant to bring about a breath of fresh air.
			</p>
			<p>
				As you take notice to the changes in our branding, digital presence and new grooves, we certainly love
				to
				connect with you. That said, please feel free to reach out with any thoughts, requests or compliments at
				any
				time. Do not hesitate to text or call us at the same number and email or simply drop by our office. If
				you
				are a frequent patron of social media, kindly connect with us through LinkedIn and Facebook for exciting
				announcements and updates. For more detailed updates, please subscribe to our newsletter.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the same time, we would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank everyone for your continuous
				trust and support. Rest assured that this will not interrupt our operations and services. On that note,
				we
				look forward to providing you with excellent services along with intuitively elegant digital solutions
				that
				bring greater values and satisfactions.
			</p>
